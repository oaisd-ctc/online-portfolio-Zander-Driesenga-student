        <h3>Castle Attack</h3>
        <div class="mainP">
        <p>This project was the first game that I made from the Mastery Coding class that was pretty much fully fleshed out. it is a very simple game but it is very healpful and taught me how to use MonoBehaviour scripts and how game managers work with changing scenes in a game</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Alchemy Lab</h3>
        <div class="mainP">
        <p>this game was an escape room like game where you need to do certain tasks to escape the lab . This project took me a bit to complete but taught me about the Unity Events system and player interactions with gameObjects. this project was a lot of fun and taught me really useful things</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Tower Defense</h3>
        <div class="mainP">
            <p>this game was a basic tower defense game where you place towers that shoot at enemies. This project has been one of the most helpful to me. it taught me manythings like lists, and enumerators. this lab was also the one that only gave you like half the answers so you would have to figure out stuff on yor own.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Infinite-monkies</h3>
        <div class="mainP">
            <p>This was a very small project that I did on my own that loops getting random numbers that are then made into letters using a switch statement (I have realized that I could have just put the Chars in an array but it is already done and I was experimenting and just wanted to use a switch statment)</p>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/oaisd-ctc/final-project-Zander-Driesenga-student">Witch Hunted</a></h3>
        <div class="mainP">
            <p>This was my first actual game I have made on my own with the only help from tutorials being things I have never learned. this used a lot of what I have already learned and also required me to get creative with things like the background which I think took the most time because all the things that could go wrong with it. It is pretty much a full on game that only took around a month to finish.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Ghost Door C# Game</h3>
        <div class="mainP">
            <p>In this lab I had to recreate a program by just seeing and interacting with the terminal outputs. This lab was pretty fun and required you to interperet what the code would be without seeing the code</p>

        <h1 id="AM">About Me</h1>
        <div class="mainP">
            <p>I would like to tell you a bit more about me. I am Zander Driesenga from Allendale Michigan. I like videogames (mostly Indi games, rougelikes and lites, single player games, and retro/emulated games), D&D, Complicated games like catan (even though I havenever played catan but is in that general section).  </p>
            <p>My asperation in life is to have fun, whether it be with my friends or in my job. Another asperation is doing things that have to do with progamming in some way.</p>
            <p>Now onto the more personal side, I am smart in ways that grades will never show like being able to see and accept my mistakes, I have ADHD (Even though that is the case this lind of job is the thing I am very interested in and am a very hard worker in this area and in this area have done better than others who also I beleave have ADHD), I have like an overall bottom up thinking where I take what is there and use that for what I need to do which means that it is hard for me to plan out things and it is easier to just start doing the task I need to do and going from there, .</p>
