        <div class="mainP">
        <p>This project was the first game that I made from the Mastery Coding class that was pretty much fully fleshed out. it is a very simple game but it is very healpful and taught me how to use MonoBehaviour scripts and how game managers work with changing scenes in a game</p>

        <div class="mainP">
        <p>This project took me a bit to complete but taught me about the Unity Events system and player interactions with gameObjects. this project was a lot of fun and taught me really useful things</p>
